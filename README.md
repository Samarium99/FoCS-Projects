> The FoCS projects focus on the use of running webpages through a webserver (@homer.stuy.edu). Python code is run using deprecated cgi rather than Flask library.

### Project Description
A cat and mouse hide-and-seek styled game in which the player(mouse) pursues cheese across five potential rooms, evading the grasp of the cat.
Click on the HTML form options to choose player's next move. Outcome varies based on randomization, with frequencies defined by the Markov chain.

This project involves:
> - HTML forms + GET/POST methods + cgi.fieldstorage for allowing the player to select their next room and passing on variables
  (using types radio, submit, and hidden);
> - Random Library to select the locations of the cheese, mouse, and cat at the initialization of the game;
> - Markov Chain + Random Library to generate the cat's next room.
> - minimal JavaScript, mainly for the purpose of editing minor details of the HTML form.

Potential advancements on this project would include the addition of a 'peek' mechanic to the game, allowing the player to spy into specific rooms, which would impact the odds of being identified by the cat and the generation of random maps and Markov Chain frequencies.
